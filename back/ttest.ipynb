The firm conducted dozens of interviews with members of OpenAI’s prior Board, OpenAI executives, advisors to the prior Board, and other pertinent witnesses; reviewed more than 30,000 documents; and evaluated various corporate actions. Based on the record developed by WilmerHale and following the recommendation of the Special Committee, the Board expressed its full confidence in Mr. Sam Altman and Mr. Greg Brockman’s ongoing leadership of OpenAI.\\n\\n“We have unanimously concluded that Sam and Greg are the right leaders for OpenAI,” stated Bret Taylor, Chair of the OpenAI Board.\\n\\nSam Altman, as CEO, will rejoin the OpenAI Board of Directors.\\n\\nThe OpenAI Board also announced today the election of three new Board members as one part of its commitment to expansion, including:\\n\\n- **Dr. Sue Desmond-Hellmann**, _former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and on the Board of Directors at Pfizer and on the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology._\\n- **Nicole Seligman**, _former EVP and Global General Counsel of Sony and President of Sony Entertainment and on the Board of Directors at Paramount Global, Meira GTx, and Intuitive Machines, Inc._\\n- **Fidji Simo**, _CEO and Chair of Instacart and on the Board of Directors at Shopify_\\n\\nThe new members have experience in leading global organizations and navigating complex regulatory environments, including backgrounds in technology, nonprofit and board governance.

Their experience and leadership will enable the Board to oversee OpenAI’s growth and to ensure that we pursue OpenAI’s mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.”\\n\\nThe Board also announced the adoption of important improvements to OpenAI’s governance structure. Key enhancements include:\\n\\n- Adopting a new set of corporate governance guidelines;\\n- Strengthening OpenAI’s Conflict of Interest Policy;\\n- Creating a whistleblower hotline to serve as an anonymous reporting resource for all OpenAI employees and contractors; and\\n- Creating additional Board committees, including a Mission & Strategy committee focused on implementation and advancement of the core mission of OpenAI.\\n\\nThe expanded board will prioritize its crucial work to enhance the governance procedures to best achieve OpenAI’s mission. “We recognize the magnitude of our role in stewarding transformative technologies for the global good,” added Taylor.\\n\\nThe Special Committee acknowledged the important work done by WilmerHale in conducting this extensive review and thanked OpenAI current and former Board members, advisors and employees for their cooperation. The Special Committee of OpenAI’s Board of Directors released a summary of findings.\\n\\nOn December 8, 2023, the Special Committee retained WilmerHale to conduct a review of the events concerning the November 17, 2023 removal of Sam Altman and Greg Brockman from the OpenAI Board of Directors and Mr. Altman’s termination as CEO. WilmerHale reviewed more than 30,000 documents; conducted dozens of interviews, including of members of OpenAI’s prior Board, OpenAI executives, advisors to the prior Board, and other pertinent witnesses; and evaluated various corporate actions.\\n\\nThe Special Committee provided WilmerHale with the resources and authority necessary to conduct a comprehensive review. Many OpenAI employees, as well as current and former Board members, cooperated with the review process. WilmerHale briefed the Special Committee several times on the progress and conclusions of the review.\\n\\nWilmerHale evaluated management and governance issues that had been brought to the prior Board’s attention, as well as additional issues that WilmerHale identified in the course of its review. WilmerHale found there was a breakdown in trust between the prior Board and Mr. Altman that precipitated the events of November 17.\\n\\nWilmerHale reviewed the public post issued by the prior Board on November 17 and concluded that the statement accurately recounted the prior Board’s decision and rationales. WilmerHale found that the prior Board believed at the time that its actions would mitigate internal management challenges and did not anticipate that its actions would destabilize the Company. WilmerHale also found that the prior Board’s decision did not arise out of concerns regarding product safety or security, the pace of development, OpenAI’s finances, or its statements to investors, customers, or business partners. Instead, it was a consequence of a breakdown in the relationship and loss of trust between the prior Board and Mr. Altman. WilmerHale found the prior Board implemented its decision on an abridged timeframe, without advance notice to key stakeholders, and without a full inquiry or an opportunity for Mr. Altman to address the prior Board’s concerns. WilmerHale found that the prior Board acted within its broad discretion to terminate Mr. Altman, but also found that his conduct did not mandate removal.\\n\\nAfter reviewing the WilmerHale findings, the Special Committee recommended to the full Board that it endorse the November 21 decision to rehire Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman. With knowledge of the review’s findings, the Special Committee expressed its full confidence in Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman’s ongoing leadership of OpenAI.\\n\\nThe Special Committee is pleased to conclude this review and looks forward to continuing with the important work of OpenAI.'}, {'title': \"OpenAI Board: Who are the New Members and What's Changed?\", 'content': \"The dust has started to settle after Sam Altman’s dramatic ousting and equally sensational return as OpenAI CEO, but there’s still plenty of commotion as the new board of the **[ChatGPT owner](https://tech.co/news/who-owns-chatgpt-and-openai)** becomes official with the blockbuster news that Microsoft will get a non-voting seat in AI’s room where it happens. Here’s all the other key changes, new OpenAI board members, and a quick look at who’s hit the road.\\n\\nA new OpenAI board was almost certainly apre-conditions for Altman’s return as CEO. After all, **[Altman was fired](https://tech.co/news/why-was-sam-altman-fired-open-ai)** by the old group of directors, ostensibly for failing to be “…consistently candid in his communications with the board.” However, it increasingly looks like the real reason for the attempted coup was concerns over **[OpenAI Q\\\\*](https://tech.co/news/what-is-openai-project-q-star-agi-superintelligence)**, the company’s reported AGI superintelligence breakthrough.\\n\\nWhatever the case, three OpenAI board members have moved on to pastures new, while fresh faces have been brought in to replace them in the form of Bret Taylor and Larry Summers. Who are they and what else is happening with the OpenAI board right now? Read on to find out.\\n\\n## OpenAI Board Confirmed with Final Addition of Microsoft\\n\\nIn a new [blog post](https://openai.com/blog/sam-altman-returns-as-ceo-openai-has-a-new-initial-board), OpenAI and Sam Altman have confirmed its new look “initial” board comprised of chair Bret Taylor, Larry Summers and Adam D’Angelo.\\n\\nThat much we already knew, but the big news is that in his first public act for the company, Taylor announced the OpenAI board would include Microsoft as a “non-voting observer.”\\n\\nMicrosoft, of course, now famously hired both Sam Altman and OpenAI President Greg Brockman for roughly 24 hours after Altman was deposed – and was understood to be ready to welcome hundreds more defectors from OpenAI, in the event of a mass resignation resulting from Altman’s firing.\\n\\nAltman also addressed the elephant in the room regarding the new OpenAI’s board glaring lack of diversity. With all of its former female board members now engaged elsewhere, the returned CEO’s blog referenced the “important task of building out a board of diverse perspectives,” again highlighting that the current setup is only the initial group of individuals, with further additions to the company’s boardroom expected.\\n\\n## **Who is Bret Taylor? New OpenAI Board Member is Former Salesforce CEO**\\n\\nBret Taylor is a 43-year-old American computer programmer, entrepreneur and the **new chair of the OpenAI board.**\\n\\nTaylor is perhaps best known as the former co-CEO of **[Salesforce](https://tech.co/crm-software/salesforce-pricing-how-much-does-salesforce-cost)**. He shared the prestigious post with Marc Benioff between November 2021 and January 2023, having previously served as the CRM giant’s president and COO. Among other things, he spearheaded the company’s acquisition of Slack.\\n\\nThe Stanford University graduate is no one-hit wonder, however. He served as chairman of Twitter alongside his 9-to-5 at Salesforce, but left the microblogging platform in 2022 when a certain Elon Musk bought the company – and promptly culled its entire board to make himself feel at home.\\n\\nTaylor also played a pivotal role in the development of two products you’ve probably used before. Launching his career as an Associate Product Manager at Google, he was part of a team of 50 Googlers who helped integrate Where 2 Technologies into the search giant’s portfolio. The product would go on become **[Google Maps](https://tech.co/news/how-to-use-new-google-maps-features)**.\\n\\nAfter Google, he helped co-found and served as CEO of one of America’s OG social networks, FriendFeed, which was acquired by Facebook in 2009 and brought with it a feature now synonymous with the social media giant: the Like button.\\n\\nTaylor replaces Altman ally Greg Brockman as OpenAI chairman, with both Altman and Brockman deciding against returning to their former seats on the board.\\n\\n_Image credit: [Brian Solis](http://www.briansolis.com/) via [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/50698336@N00/3707793530) (shared under Creative Commons [Attribution 2.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/deed.en))_\\n\\n## **Who is Larry Summers? OpenAI Board Adds Outspoken Economist**\\n\\nLawrence “Larry” Summers is a 68-year-old American economist who has previously held a number of prestigious posts in the world of economics.\\n\\nThese include being the US Secretary of the Treasury under Bill Clinton between 1999 and 2001 and then president of the National Economic Council under Barack Obama from 2009-2011.\\n\\nIn between holding this high-ranking governmental posts, Summers served as president of his alma mater, Harvard University, from 2001-2006. Earlier in his career, he was Chief Economist at the World Bank (1991 to 1993), where he counted future Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg among his mentees.\\n\\nAway from his distinguished resume, Sanders is a man known for his strong opinions on all things economic, famously calling the Biden administration’s flagship $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan “the least responsible policy we’ve had in the last 40 years.”\\n\\nIn a similar vein, he referred to the UK’s “Brexit” withdrawal from the EU “the worst self-inflicted policy wound that a country has done since the Second World War”.\\n\\nWhile his economic pedigree can’t be doubted, there’s also no shying away from the fact that he’s a more polarizing figure than Taylor, with some of his comments and views being judged controversial in the past.\\n\\n## **Who is Adam D’Angelo? The OpenAI Board Member Who Survived**\\n\\nThe third and currently final member of the new OpenAI board is 39-year-old American Adam D’Angelo, best known as the co-founder and current CEO of Quora.\\n\\nA graduate of the California Institute of Technology, his career started in the social media world, with D’Angelo joining Facebook shortly after its launch in 2004. He rose to be its Chief Technology Officer between 2006 and 2008, whilst also serving as its VP of Engineering.\\n\\nHe is the lone OpenAI board member to have survived the recent chaos surround Sam Altman’s firing and rehiring, for reasons that remain unclear. That said, he’s widely regarded as one of Silicon Valley’s brightest minds and won a silver medal in the 2002 Olympiad in Infomatics, the Olympics of the computer science world.\\n\\nAway from OpenAI, D’Angelo has his own AI startup called Poe, and was a notable investor in both Instagram and the project management platform **[Asana](https://tech.co/project-management-software/asana-pricing)**.\\n\\nHis leadership style at Quora has come into the spotlight as a result of his role in Altman saga, with The Information [reporting](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-quiet-silicon-valley-insider-complicating-sam-altmans-return) that he has never once been known to change his stance on a position or issue.\\n\\n_Image Credit: [Philip Neustrom](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipn/) via [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/philipn/5326344032/) (shared under Creative Commons [Attribution 2.0 Generic](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) license)_\\n\\n## **Is Sam Altman on the OpenAI Board?**\\n\\nWhile Sam Altman was previously on the OpenAI board, it is understood that the newly returned CEO of the ChatGPT developer will no longer be occupying a board seat.\\n\\nNor will OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, who followed Altman out of the revolving OpenAI door but has now also returned. Prior to the attempted coup, Altman and Brockman were two of the six board members.\\n\\nIt will be a major change for Altman, who has been part of the OpenAI board since back in 2015 when the company was born. The initial board then consisted of just two members: Altman and Elon Musk.\\n\\n## **Who Was on the OpenAI Board?**\\n\\nPrior to the situation surrounding Sam Altman’s leadership, there were six OpenAI board members.\\n\\nIn addition to Altman, co-founder and president Greg Brockman, and the retained Adam D’Angelo, a trio of big names have now left their roles in the OpenAI boardroom after the ultimately failed coup.\\n\\nThese are:\\n\\n- Ilya Sutskever\\n- Tasha McCauley\\n- Helen Toner\\n\\nOf these, Sutskever is perhaps the most noteworthy – or at least played the biggest part in briefly overthrowing Altman.\\n\\nAn OpenAI co-founder and still (for now) listing himself as its Chief Scientist, Sutskever quickly reversed course and said he regretted ousting Altman.\\n\\n> I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI. I love everything we've built together and I will do everything I can to reunite the company.\\n>\\n> — Ilya Sutskever (@ilyasut) [November 20, 2023](https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\\n\\nFor their part, McCauley is a robotics engineer and the CEO of GeoSim Systems, while Helen Toner is a Research Associate with the Centre for the Governance of AI, as well as Director of Strategy at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\\n\\n## **What the Heck Happened at OpenAI?**\\n\\nChaos, in a word. Late last week, the OpenAI board fired CEO Sam Altman, prompting mass employee protests and the resignation of another leading face at **[ChatGPT](https://tech.co/news/what-is-chatgpt-beginners-guide-simple)**, Greg Brockman.\\n\\nIn almost the same breath as Altman was fired, speculation emerged linking him with a swift return to the company, though by Monday morning it looked like water under the bridge.\\n\\nAltman had accepted a new job at Microsoft, while former Twitch boss Emmett Shear had been appointed as new interim CEO at OpenAI.\\n\\nHowever, the saga wasn’t over yet. Eventually, the weight of more than 700 of OpenAI’s roughly 770 employees calling for the board’s resignation and Altman’s reinstatement was too much and on Wednesday, November 22 it was confirmed that Altman would return.\\n\\nThis, in turn, meant the departure of Ilya Sutskever, Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley from the OpenAI board, with Bret Taylor and Larry Summers brought in as part of the new line-up.\\n\\nIn the end, it’s thought that as many as six additional new OpenAI board members could be brought in over the coming weeks, though there’s no indication as yet who they might be.\\n\\nWatch this space, as we’ll update this guide to feature any and all new OpenAI board members that get announced.\\n\\nDid you find this article helpful?Click on one of the following buttons\\n\\nWe're so happy you liked!

OpenAI’s former board of directors included Altman, Musk (who left in early 2018), Sutskever and several non-founding investors and A.I. experts. Today, the company is governed by an entirely new board, consisting of seven members from various backgrounds in tech, policy and academia.\\n\\n### Here are the nine notable executives and seven board directors running OpenAI:\\n\\n### **Sam Altman, 39, CEO**\\n\\nAltman became the CEO of OpenAI’sfor-profit entity when it was created in 2019.

People and the media keep going off about how Altman, et. al. don\\'t have equity in the OpenAI foundation and completely taking their eye off the ball as to where the money is. I\\'d bet all my money that everyone on the board DO have equity stakes in the OpenAI Global LLC subsidiary. Microsoft is a minority investor in that company so that leaves 51% to be divvied up between the board members and the OpenAI foundation itself. Sure, it\\'s a capped profit company, but who wouldn\\'t take a few percent on a few bil in revenue? This is why the board is talking to Altman about coming back again because Microsoft will take their money ball and go home. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n Comment by: redditfriendguy\\n | Posted (UTC): 2023-11-18\\n | Score: 1\\n \\n Fuck ilya I hate that guy now.

But I also think that this move can do more harm to their mission than the \"too fast / too commercial\" approach of Altman. \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n Comment by: redditfriendguy\\n | Posted (UTC): 2023-11-18\\n | Score: 1\\n \\n Safety cuck \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n Comment by: Reasonable-Hat-287\\n | Posted (UTC): 2023-11-18\\n | Score: 1\\n \\n In the larger scheme of things, our common enemy is time and death. \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n Comment by: redditfriendguy\\n | Posted (UTC): 2023-11-19\\n | Score: 1\\n \\n Many people older than me do not fear death and feel they have spent enough time.
